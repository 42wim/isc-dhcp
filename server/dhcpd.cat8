       dhcpd(8)  implements the Dynamic Host Configuration Proto-
       col (DHCP) and the Internet  Bootstrap  Protocol  (BOOTP).
       DHCP  allows  hosts  on a TCP/IP network to request and be
       assigned IP addresses, and also  to  discover  information
       about  the network to which they are attached.  BOOTP pro-
       vides similar but much more limited functionality.

OOPPEERRAATTIIOONN
       The DHCP protocol allows a host which is  unknown  to  the
       network  administrator  to be automatically assigned a new
       IP address out of a pool of IP addresses for its  network.
       In order for this to work, the network administrator allo-
       cates address pools in each subnet and  enters  them  into
       the dhcpd.conf(5) file.

       On  startup, dhcpd reads the _d_h_c_p_d_._c_o_n_f file and keeps the
       list of available addresses  on  each  subnet  in  memory.
       When  a  host requests an address using the DHCP protocol,
       dhcpd allocates an address for  it.   Each  such  host  is
       assigned  a  lease,  which expires after an amount of time
       chosen by the administrator (by  default,  one  day).   As
       leases  expire,  the  hosts to which they are assigned are
       expected to renew the leases if they wish to  continue  to
       use the addresses.   Once a lease has expired, the host to
       which that lease is assigned is no longer permitted to use
       the IP address assigned to it.

       In order to keep track of leases across system reboots and
       server restarts, dhcpd keeps  a  list  of  leases  it  has
       assigned  in  the  dhcpd.leases(5)  file.    Before  dhcpd
       grants a lease to a host, it records  the  lease  in  this
       file  and  makes  sure  that  the contents of the file are
       flushed to disk.   This ensures that even in the event  of
       a  system  crash, dhcpd will not forget about a lease that
       it  has  assigned.    On  startup,   after   reading   the
       dhcpd.conf  file,  dhcpd  reads  the  dhcpd.leases file to
       refresh its memory about what leases have been assigned.

       New leases are appended to the  end  of  the  dhcpd.leases
       file.    In  order to prevent the file from becoming arbi-
       trarily large, from time  to  time  dhcpd  creates  a  new
       dhcpd.leases  file  from its in-core lease database.  Once
       this file has been  written  to  disk,  the  old  file  is
       renamed   _d_h_c_p_d_._l_e_a_s_e_s_~,  and  the  new  file  is  renamed
       dhcpd.leases.   If the system crashes  in  the  middle  of
       this  process,  whichever  dhcpd.leases  file remains will
       contain all the lease information, so there is no need for



                                                                1

       a special crash recovery process.

       BOOTP  support  is  also provided by this server.   Unlike
       DHCP, the BOOTP protocol requires that the server know the
       hardware address of the client that is to be booted.   The
       network administrator must determine that  address,  allo-
       cate an IP address for the client, and enter that informa-
       tion into the dhcpd.conf file.

       Whenever changes are made to the  dhcpd.conf  file,  dhcpd
       must  be  restarted.    To  restart  dhcpd, send a SIGTERM
       (signal 15) to the process ID contained in _/_d_h_c_p_d_._p_i_d, and
       then re-invoke dhcpd.

       The  syntax  of the dhcpd.conf(8) file is discussed seper-
       ately.   This section should be used as an overview of the
       configuration process, and the dhcpd.conf(8) documentation
       should be consulted for detailed reference information.

       dhcpd needs to know the subnet numbers and netmasks of all
       subnets for which it will be providing service.   In addi-
       tion, in order to dynamically allocate addresses, it  must
       be assigned one or more ranges of addresses on each subnet
       which it can in turn assign to client hosts as they  boot.
       Thus,  a  very simple configuration providing DHCP support
       might look like this:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250;

       Multiple address ranges may be specified like this:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107
              range 239.252.197.113 239.252.197.250;

       If a subnet will only be provided with BOOTP  service  and
       no  dynamic  address  assignment,  the range clause can be
       left out entirely, but the subnet statement must appear.

       DHCP leases can be assigned almost any  length  from  zero
       seconds  to  infinity.   What lease length makes sense for
       any given subnet, or for any given installation, will vary
       depending on the kinds of hosts being served.

       For  example,  in  an office environment where systems are
       added from time to time and removed from time to time, but
       move relatively infrequently, it might make sense to allow



                                                                2





dhcpd(8)                                                 dhcpd(8)


       lease times of a month of more.   In a final test environ-
       ment  on  a manufacturing floor, it may make more sense to
       assign a maximum lease length of 30 minutes - enough  time
       to  go through a simple test procedure on a network appli-
       ance before packaging it up for delivery.

       It is possible to specify two lease lengths:  the  default
       length  that  will be assigned if a client doesn't ask for
       any particular lease length, and a maximum  lease  length.
       These are specified as clauses to the subnet command:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.107
              default-lease-time 600
              max-lease-time 7200;

       This  particular  subnet  declaration  specifies a default
       lease time of 600 seconds (ten  minutes),  and  a  maximum
       lease  time  of  7200  seconds (two hours).   Other common
       values would be 86400 (one day),  604800  (one  week)  and
       2592000 (30 days).

       Each  subnet  need not have the same lease--in the case of
       an office  environment  and  a  manufacturing  environment
       served  by  the  same  DHCP server, it might make sense to
       have widely disparate values for default and maximum lease
       times on each subnet.

       Each  BOOTP  client  must  be  explicitly  declared in the
       dhcpd.conf file.   A very basic  client  declaration  will
       specify  the  client  network interface's hardware address
       and the IP address to assign  to  that  client.    If  the
       client  needs  to  be  able  to  load a boot file from the
       server, that file's name must  be  specified.    A  simple
       bootp client declaration might look like this:

            host haagen hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23
              fixed-address 239.252.197.9
              filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot";

OOppttiioonnss
       DHCP  (and  also  BOOTP  with Vendor Extensions) provide a
       mechanism whereby the server can provide the  client  with
       information  about  how to configure its network interface
       (e.g., subnet mask), and also how the  client  can  access
       various  network  services  (e.g., DNS, IP routers, and so
       on).

       These options can be specified on a per-subnet basis, and,
       for  BOOTP  clients,  also on a per-client basis.   In the
       event that a BOOTP client  declaration  specifies  options
       that  are  also  specified  in its subnet declaration, the
       options  specified  in   the   client   declaration   take



                                                                3

       precedence.    An  reasonably  complete DHCP configuration
       might look something like this:

            subnet 239.252.197.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
              range 239.252.197.10 239.252.197.250
              default-lease-time 600 max-lease-time 7200
              option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0
              option broadcast-address 239.252.197.255
              option routers 239.252.197.1
              option domain-name-servers 239.252.197.2, 239.252.197.3
              option domain-name "isc.org";

       A bootp host on that subnet that needs to be in a  differ-
       ent  domain  and  use  a  different  name  server might be
       declared as follows:

            host haagen hardware ethernet 08:00:2b:4c:59:23
              fixed-address 239.252.197.9
              filename "/tftpboot/haagen.boot"
              option domain-name-servers 192.5.5.1
              option domain-name "vix.com";

       A complete list of DHCP Options and their syntaxes is pro-
       vided in dhcpd.conf(5).
