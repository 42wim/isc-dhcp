.Dt dhcpd.conf 5
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpd.conf
.Nd dhcpd configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr dhcpd.conf 5
file contains configuration information for
.Xr dhcpd 8 ,
the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol daemon.   A primer on
configuring
.Nm dhcpd
is included in
.Xr dhcpd 8 .
This document describes the format of the file in detail, and is
probably a better reference than a primer.
.Pp
The
.Nm dhcpd.conf
file is a free-form ASCII text file.   It is parsed by a
recursive-descent parser.   Statements in the file may contain extra
tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.   Each statement in the
file is terminated by a semicolon.   Keywords in the file are
case-insensitive.
.Pp
There are currently two statements that can
meaningfully appear in the file\(emthe
.Nm subnet
statement, and the
.Nm host
statement.
.Sh The SUBNET statement
.Nm subnet
.Ar subnet-number
.Nm netmask
.Ar netmask
.Op Ar clauses ;
.Pp
.Ar subnet-number
should be an IP address or DNS name which resolves to the subnet
number of the subnet being described.
.Ar netmask
should be an IP address or DNS name which resolves to the subnet mask
of the subnet being described. These are the only required fields
in a subnet declaration, although it may be desirable to add one or
more of the following clauses.
.Pp
Subnets for which addresses will be dynamically allocated must have
one or more addresses reserved for future allocation by
.Nm dhcpd .
These addresses are allocated using the
.Nm range
clause.
.Pp
.Nm range
.Ar lowest-address
.Ar highest-address
.Pp
.Ar Lowest-address
should be the lowest address in the range that may be assigned by
.Nm dhcpd
to a DHCP client.
.Ar Highest-address
should be the highest address in the range that may be assigned by
.Nm dhcpd .
If there is only one address in a range, it must be specified as both
the lowest and highest addresses.  As many
.Nm range
clauses as are needed may be specified in any given
.Nm subnet
statement.
.Pp
.Nm default-lease-time
.Ar time
.Pp
.Ar Time
should be the expiration time in seconds that will be assigned to a
lease if the client requesting the lease does not ask for a specific
expiration time.   This clause may only appear once in each
.Nm subnet
statement.
.Pp
.Nm max-lease-time
.Ar time
.Pp
.Ar Time
should be the maximum expiration time in seconds that will be assigned
to a lease if the client requesting the lease asks for a specific
expiration time.   This clause may only appear once in each
.Nm subnet
statement.
.Pp
.Nm option
.Ar option-declaration
.Pp
Any number of
.Nm
option clauses may appear in a subnet statement.   The syntax of
option declarations is described later in this document.
.Sh The HOST statement
.Nm host
.Ar hostname
.Op Ar clauses ;
.Pp
There must be at least one
.Nm host
statement for every BOOTP client that is to be served.
.Ar hostname
should be a name identifying the host.   It is for labelling purposes
only, and is not used in the BOOTP protocol.
.Pp
.Nm hardware
.Ar hardware-type
.Ar hardware-address
.Pp
In order for a BOOTP client to be recognized, its network hardware
address must be declared using a
.Nm hardware
clause in the
.Nm host
statement.   Only one such clause can appear in any host statement.
.Ar hardware-type
must be the name of a physical hardware interface type.   Currently,
only the
.Nm ethernet
type is recognized, although support for
.Nm token-ring
and
.Nm fddi
hardware types will be added soon.
The
.Ar hardware-address
should be a set of hexadecimal octets (numbers from 0 through ff)
seperated by colons.
.Pp
.Nm filename
.Ar filename
.Pp
If the BOOTP client needs to load a boot file (for example, a kernel
or configuration file), the name of this file may be provided to the
client using the
.Nm filename
clause.   The
.Ar filename
should be a filename recognizable to whatever file transfer protocol
the client can be expected to use to load the file.
.Pp
.Nm fixed-address
.Ar address
.Pp
BOOTP clients must be assigned fixed IP addresses.   The
.Nm fixed-address
clause is used to associate a fixed IP address with a BOOTP client.
.Ar Address
should be either an IP address or a DNS name which resolves to a
single IP address.
.Pp
.Nm option
.Ar option-declaration
.Pp
Any number of
.Nm
option clauses may appear in a host statement.   The syntax of
option declarations is described later in this document.   If an
option clause in a
.Nm host
statement conflicts with an option clause in the
.Nm subnet
statement for the subnet containing that host, the option clause in
the
.Nm host
statement is used.
.Pp
.Sh Option Declarations
.Pp
Option declarations always start with the
.Nm option
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.   The
option names and data formats are described below.   Many of the
options described below which set IP or TCP parameters have default
values which will generally work perfectly well, so only those options
whose values must be set explicitly should be included in
.Nm subnet
or
.Nm host
statements.
.Pp
Option data comes in a variety of formats.   In order to avoid having
to explain the formats along with each option definition below, a
number of data types have been defined.
.Pp
The ip-address data type can be entered either as an explicit IP
address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g.,
haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that
domain name resolves to a single IP address.
.Pp
The int32 data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.   The uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.   The int16 and uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.   The int8 and
uint8 data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
.Pp
The string data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be
enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a domain-name
option, the syntax would be
.nf
.sp 1
	option domain-name "isc.org"
.fi
.Pp
The flag data type specifies a one-bit (boolean) number.

The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.
