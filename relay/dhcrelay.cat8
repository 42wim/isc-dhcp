     The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Relay Agent, dhcrelay,
     provides a means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a
     subnet to which no DHCP server is directly to  one  or  more
     DHCP servers on other subnets.

     The DHCP Relay Agent listens for DHCP and BOOTP queries  and
     responses.  When a query is received from a client, dhcrelay
     forwards it to the list of DHCP  servers  specified  on  the
     command line.  When a reply is received from a server, it is
     broadcast or unicast (according to the relay agent's ability
     or  the client's request) on the network from which the ori-
     ginal request came.

     The names of the network  interfaces  that  dhcrelay  should
     attempt  to  configure  may be specified on the command line
     using the ----iiii option.  If no interface names are specified on
     the  command  line dhcrelay will identify all network inter-
     faces, elimininating non-broadcast interfaces  if  possible,
     and attempt to configure each interface.

     If a relay agent is running on a system that is connected to
     one  or  more networks on which no DHCP servers are present,
     and is also connected to one or more networks on which  DHCP
     servers  _a_r_e  connected,  it  is  may not be helpful for the
     relay agent to relay requests from those networks on which a
     DHCP  server already exists.  To avoid such a situation, the
     interfaces on which the relay agent should listen should  be
     specified with the ----iiii flag.

     Note that in some cases it _i_s helpful for the relay agent to
     forward  requests  from  networks  on which a DHCP server is
     running to other DHCP servers.   This would be the  case  if
     two  DHCP  servers  on different networks were being used to
     provide backup service for each other's networks.

     If dhcrelay should listen and transmit on a port other  than
     the  standard (port 67), the ----pppp flag may used.  It should be
     followed by the udp port number that  dhcrelay  should  use.
     This is mostly useful for debugging purposes.

     Dhcrelay will normally run in the foreground  until  it  has
     configured  an interface, and then will revert to running in
     the background.  To run force dhcrelay to always  run  as  a
     foreground  process,  the ----dddd flag should be specified.  This
     is useful when running dhcrelay under a  debugger,  or  when
     running it out of inittab on System V systems.

     Dhcrelay will normally print its  network  configuration  on
     startup.   This can be annoying in a system startup script -
     to disable this behaviour, specify the ----qqqq flag.

     If the ----aaaa flag is set the relay agent will append  an  agent
     option  field  to  each  request before forwarding it to the
     server.   Agent option fields in responses sent from servers
     to clients will be stripped before forwarding such responses
     back to the client.

     The agent option field will contain two agent  options:  the
     Circuit ID suboption and the Agent ID suboption.  Currently,
     the Circuit ID will be the printable name of  the  interface
     on  which  the  client  request was received.   The Agent ID
     will be the value that the relay agent stores  in  the  DHCP
     packet's  giaddr field.   The client supports inclusion of a
     Remote ID suboption  as  well,  but  this  is  not  used  by
     default.

     _N_o_t_e: The Agent ID suboption is not defined in  the  current
     Relay  Agent Information Option draft (draft-ietf-dhc-agent-
     options-03.txt), but has been proposed for inclusion in  the
     next draft.

     Relay Agent options are added to a DHCP packet  without  the
     knowledge  of  the DHCP client.   The client may have filled
     the DHCP packet option  buffer  completely,  in  which  case
     there  theoretically  isn't  any space to add Agent options.
     However, the DHCP server may be able to handle a much larger
     packet  than  most  DHCP  clients  would send.   The current
     Agent Options draft requires that the relay agent use a max-
     imum packet size of 576 bytes.

     It is recommended that with the Internet Software Consortium
     DHCP  server,  the maximum packet size be set to about 1400,
     allowing plenty of extra space in which the relay agent  can
     put  the  agent  option  field, while still fitting into the
     Ethernet MTU size.  This can be done by  specifying  the  ----AAAA
     flag,  followed  by  the  desired maximum packet size (e.g.,
     1400).

     Note that this is reasonably safe to  do  even  if  the  MTU
     between the server and the client is less than 1500, as long
     as the hosts on which the  server  and  client  are  running

     support  IP  fragmentation  (and  they  should).   With some
     knowledge as to how large the agent options might get  in  a
     particular  configuration,  this  parameter  can be tuned as
     finely as necessary.

     It is possible for a relay agent to receive a  packet  which
     already contains an agent option field.  If this packet does
     not have a giaddr set, the standard requires that the packet
     be discarded.

     If giaddr is set, the server may handle the situation in one
     of  four ways: it may _a_p_p_e_n_d its own set of relay options to
     the packet, leaving the supplied option field  intact.    It
     may _r_e_p_l_a_c_e the existing agent option field.  It may _f_o_r_w_a_r_d
     the packet unchanged.   Or, it may _d_i_s_c_a_r_d it.

     Which of  these  behaviours  is  followed  by  the  Internet
     Software  Consortium DHCP Relay Agent may be configured with
     the ----mmmm flag, followed by one of the four keywords  specified
     in _i_t_a_l_i_c_s above.

     When the relay agent receives a reply  from  a  server  that
     it's supposed to forward to a client, and Relay Agent Infor-
     mation option processing is enabled, the relay  agent  scans
     the  packet  for Relay Agent Information options and removes
     them.   As it's scanning, if it finds a Relay Agent Informa-
     tion  option  field  containing  an  Agent ID suboption that
     matches one of its IP addresses, that option  is  recognized
     as  its  own.    If no such option is found, the relay agent
     can either drop the packet, or relay it anyway.   If the  ----DDDD
     option  is specified, all packets that don't contain a match
     will be dropped.

     The name or IP address of at least one DHCP server to  which
     DHCP  and BOOTP requests should be relayed must be specified

     It should be possible for the user to define the Circuit  ID
     and Remote ID values on a per-interface basis.

     The relay agent should not relay packets received on a  phy-
     sical network to DHCP servers on the same physical network -
     if they do, the server will receive duplicate packets.    In
     order to fix this, however, the relay agent needs to be able
     to learn about the network topology, which requires that  it
     have a configuration file.
