.TH dhcpd-options 5
.SH NAME
dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration protocol allows the client to receive
.B options
from the DHCP server describing the network configuration and various
services that are available on the network.   When configuring
.B dhcpd(8)
or
.B dhclient(8) ,
options must often be declared.   The syntax for declaring options,
and the names and formats of the options that can be declared, are
documented here.
.SH REFERENCE: OPTION STATEMENTS
.PP
DHCP \fIoption\fR statements always start with the \fIoption\fR
keyword, followed by an option name, followed by option data.  The
option names and data formats are described below.   It is not
necessary to exhaustively specify all DHCP options - only those
options which are needed by clients must be specified.
.PP
Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:
.PP
The
.B ip-address
data type can be entered either as an explicit IP
address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a domain name (e.g.,
haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that
domain name resolves to a single IP address.
.PP
The
.B int32
data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.   The 
.B uint32
data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit integer.   The 
.B int16
and
.B uint16
data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.   The 
.B int8
and
.B uint8
data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.
Unsigned 8-bit integers are also sometimes referred to as octets.
.PP
The
.B string
data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be
enclosed in double quotes - for example, to specify a domain-name
option, the syntax would be
.nf
.sp 1
	option domain-name "isc.org";
.fi
.PP
The
.B flag
data type specifies a boolean value.   Booleans can be either true or
false (or on or off, if that makes more sense to you).
.PP
The
.B string
data type specifies either an NVT ASCII string
enclosed in double quotes, or a series of octets specified in
hexadecimal, seperated by colons.   For example:
.nf
.sp 1
	option dhcp-client-identifier "CLIENT-FOO";
or
	option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;
.fi
.PP
The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken
from the latest IETF draft document on DHCP options.   Options which
are not listed by name may be defined by the name option-\fInnn\fR,
where \fInnn\fI is the decimal number of the option code.   These
options may be followed either by a string, enclosed in quotes, or by
a series of octets, expressed as two-digit hexadecimal numbers seperated
by colons.   For example:
.PP
.nf
	option option-133 "my-option-133-text";
	option option-129 1:54:c9:2b:47;
.fi
.PP
Because dhcpd does not know the format of these undefined option codes,
no checking is done to ensure the correctness of the entered data.
.PP
The standard options are:
.PP
.B option subnet-mask \fIip-address\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
The subnet mask option specifies the client's subnet mask as per RFC
950.  If no subnet mask option is provided anywhere in scope, as a
last resort dhcpd will use the subnet mask from the subnet declaration
for the network on which an address is being assigned.  However,
.I any
subnet-mask option declaration that is in scope for the address being
assigned will override the subnet mask specified in the subnet
declaration.
.RE

.SH RELAY AGENT INFORMATION OPTION
An IETF draft, draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-03.txt, defines a series
of encapsulated options that a relay agent can add to a DHCP packet
when relaying it to the DHCP server.   The server can then make
address allocation decisions (or whatever other decisions it wants)
based on these options.   The server also returns these options in any
replies it sends through the relay agent, so that the relay agent can
use the information in these options for delivery or accounting
purposes.
.PP
The current draft defines two options.   To reference
these options in the dhcp server, specify the option space name,
"agent", followed by a period, followed by the option name.   It isn't
useful to specify these options to be sent, nor is it useful to
reference them at all in the client.
.PP
.B option \fBagent.circuit-id\fR \fIstring\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
The circuit-id suboption encodes an agent-local identifier of the
circuit from which a DHCP client-to-server packet was received.  It is
intended for use by agents in relaying DHCP responses back to the
proper circuit.   The format of this option is currently defined to be
vendor-dependent, and will probably remain that way, although the
current draft allows for for the possibility of standardizing the
format in the future.
.RE
.PP
.B option \fBagent.remote-id\fR \fIstring\fR\fB;\fR
.RS 0.25i
.PP
The remote-id suboption encodes information about the remote host end
of a circuit.   Examples of what it might contain include caller ID
information, username information, remote ATM address, cable modem ID,
and similar things.   In principal, the meaning is not well-specified,
and it should generally be assumed to be an opaque object that is
administratively guaranteed to be unique to a particular remote end of
a circuit.
.SH DEFINING NEW OPTIONS
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client and server provide the
capability to define new options.   Each DHCP option has a name, a
code, and a structure.   The name is used by you to refer to the
option.   The code is a number, used by the DHCP server and client to
refer to an option.   The structure describes what the contents of an
option looks like.
.PP
To define a new option, you need to choose a name for it that is not
in use for some other option - for example, you can't use "host-name"
because the DHCP protocol already defines a host-name option, which is
documented earlier in this manual page.   If an option name doesn't
appear in this manual page, you can use it, but it's probably a good
idea to put some kind of unique string at the beginning so you can be
sure that future options don't take your name.   For example, you
might define an option, "local-host-name", feeling some confidence
that no official DHCP option name will ever start with "local".
.PP
Once you have chosen a name, you must choose a code.  For site-local
options, all codes between 128 and 254 are reserved for DHCP options,
so you can pick any one of these.  In practice, some vendors have
interpreted the protocol rather loosely and have used option code
values greater than 128 themselves.   There's no real way to avoid
this problem, but it's not likely to cause too much trouble in
practice.
.PP
The structure of an option is simply the format in which the option
data appears.   The ISC DHCP server currently supports a few simple
types, like integers, booleans, strings and IP addresses, and it also
supports the ability to define arrays of single types or arrays of
fixed sequences of types.
.PP
New options are declared as follows:
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.I definition
.B ;
.PP
The values of
.I new-name
and
.I new-code
should be the name you have chosen for the new option and the code you
have chosen.   The
.I definition
should be the definition of the structure of the option.
.PP
The following simple option type definitions are supported:
.PP
.B BOOLEAN
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B boolean
.B ;
.PP
An option of type boolean is a flag with a value of either on or off
(or true or false).   So an example use of the boolean type would be:
.nf

	option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean;
	option use-zephyr on;

.fi
.B INTEGER
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.I sign
.B integer
.I width
.B ;
.PP
The \fIsign\fR token should either be blank, \fIunsigned\fR
or \fIsigned\fR.   The width can be either 8, 16 or 32, and refers to
the number of bits in the integer.   So for example, the following two
lines show a definition of the sql-connection-max option and its use:
.nf

	option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer 16;
	option sql-connection-max 1536;

.fi
.B IP-ADDRESS
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B ip-address
.B ;
.PP
An option whose structure is an IP address can be expressed either as
a domain name or as a dotted quad.  So the following is an example use
of the ip-address type:
.nf

	option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address;
	option sql-server-address sql.example.com;

.fi
.PP
.B TEXT
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B text
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text string.   For
example:
.nf

	option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
	option sql-default-connection-name "PRODZA";

.fi
.PP
.B DATA STRING
.PP
.B option
.I new-name
.B code
.I new-code
.B =
.B string
.B ;
.PP
An option whose type is a data string is essentially just a collection
of bytes, and can be specified either as quoted text, like the text
type, or as a list of hexadecimal contents seperated by colons whose
values must be between 0 and FF.   For example:
.nf

	option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
	option sql-identification-token 17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;

.fi
.PP
.B ARRAYS
.PP
Options can contain arrays of any of the above types except for the
text and data string types, which aren't currently supported in
arrays.   An example of an array definition is as follows:
.nf

	option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
	option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;

.fi
.B RECORDS
.PP
Options can also contain data structures consisting of a sequence of
data types, which is sometimes called a record type.   For example:
.nf

	option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32, text };
	option contrived-001 on 1772 "contrivance";

.fi
It's also possible to have options that are arrays of records, for
example:
.nf

	option new-static-routes code 201 = array of {
		ip-address, ip-address, ip-address, integer 8 };
	option static-routes
		10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 net-0-rtr.example.com 1,
		10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 net-1-rtr.example.com 1,
		10.2.0.0 255.255.224.0 net-2-0-rtr.example.com 3;
