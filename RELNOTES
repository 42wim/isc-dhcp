			    Release Notes

This is version 1.0 Patchlevel 1 of the Internet Software Consortium
DHCP Server The previous version was Version 1.0.

              CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.0 BETA 1 PATCHLEVEL 0

- Fix two potential buffer overflow problems.

- Clarify socket API error message on multiple interfaces.

- Fix broken comparison that was setting IP source address to zero.

- Only return 64 bytes of options to BOOTP clients, as specified in
  BOOTP protocol.

- Documentation fixes.


			CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0

- Minor adjustment to dhcpd.8 documentation.

	    CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0, BETA 5, PATCHLEVEL 17

- Added a man page for dhcpd.leases.

- Updated README to answer some frequently asked questions.

- Fixed a compile problem on Solaris 2.6.

- Support interface aliases on Solaris.

- Print day and month with leading zero in lease files if less than
  ten, for easier parsing by perl/sed/awk scripts.

- Never make the lease database world writable, even if dhcpd is
  invoked with a bogus umask.

- Fix DHCPRELEASE handling (before, addressed would never be
  released.)

- If there is more than one lease for a particular client on a
  particular network, find the lease the client is asking for so as to
  avoid a cycle of NAKs.

- If a BOOTP request is received from a particular client and that
  client has previously received a DHCP address, make sure that we
  still find a valid BOOTP lease so that we don't cycle through
  addresses.

- Remove server-identifier option from documentation, other than to
  document that it has been deprecated.

- Don't give up if we get an EINTR or EAGAIN while polling or
  selecting - these return statuses can occur spuriously without
  indicating a fatal problem.

- Do not select for exceptions, since we don't handle them.   This was
  causing massive CPU consumption on some systems.

- When a DHCP client has been assigned a fixed address but had
  previously had a lease, it will request the old leased address.   In
  such an event, send a DHCPNAK so that it will discover its new
  static binding.
