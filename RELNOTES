			    Release Notes

This is a development snapshot of Version 3 of the Internet Software
Consortium DHCP Distribution.

			     NEW FEATURES

Version 3, Beta 2 of the ISC DHCP Distribution includes the following
features that are new since version 2.0:

     - DHCP Failover Protocol support
     - OMAPI, an API for accessing and modifying the DHCP server and
       client state.
     - Conditional behaviour
     - Storing arbitrary information on leases
     - Address pools with access control
     - Client classing
     - Address allocation restriction by class
     - Relay agent information option support 
     - Dynamic DNS updates
     - Many bug fixes, performance enhancements, and minor new DHCP
       protocol features. 

This release is running in production at the ISC and at quite a few
other sites.  At this point, the 3.0 release is reasonably stable, but
is really only recommended for sites that are in a position to
experiment, or for sites that need the new features.  Bug reports are
enthusiastically solicited.

For information on how to install, configure and run this software,
as well as how to find documentation and report bugs, please consult
the README file.

The Dynamic DNS Update support is a descendent of an implementation
done by Lans Carstensen and Brian Dols at Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology, Jim Watt at Perkin-Elmer, Irina Goble at Integrated
Measurement Systems, and Brian Murrell at BC Tel Advanced
Communications.  I'd like to express my thanks to all of these good
people here, both for working on the code and for prodding me into
improving it.
