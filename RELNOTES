			    Release Notes

This is a development snapshot of Version 3 of the Internet Software
Consortium DHCP Distribution.

			     NEW FEATURES

Version 3, Beta 2 of the ISC DHCP Distribution includes the following
features that are new since version 2.0:

     - DHCP Failover Protocol support
     - OMAPI, an API for accessing and modifying the DHCP server and
       client state.
     - Conditional behaviour
     - Storing arbitrary information on leases
     - Address pools with access control
     - Client classing
     - Address allocation restriction by class
     - Relay agent information option support 
     - Dynamic DNS updates
     - Many bug fixes, performance enhancements, and minor new DHCP
       protocol features. 

This beta release is quite new, and is running in production at only a
few sites.   We strongly recommend that you exercise caution in
installing it.   The 3.0 Beta 2 lease file is not backwards compatible
with the 3.0 Beta 1 lease file, so if you have to go back, you will
have to convert your lease files back to the 3.0 Beta 1 format - if
you try to run a 3.0 Beta 1 server on a 3.0 Beta 2 lease file, it will
cheerfully delete all your leases.   Having said that, of course the
way that new releases of open source software become stable is by
people using them, finding the bugs, and reporting the bugs.   So
while we urge you to exercise caution, we would also appreciate any
testing or production use you can safely do.

For information on how to install, configure and run this software,
as well as how to find documentation and report bugs, please consult
the README file.

The Dynamic DNS Update support is a descendent of an implementation
done by Lans Carstensen and Brian Dols at Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology, Jim Watt at Perkin-Elmer, Irina Goble at Integrated
Measurement Systems, and Brian Murrell at BC Tel Advanced
Communications.  I'd like to express my thanks to all of these good
people here, both for working on the code and for prodding me into
improving it.

		Changes since 3.0 Beta 2 Patchlevel 1

- Notice when SIOCFIGCONF returns more data than fit in the buffer -
  allocate a larger buffer, and retry.   Thanks to Greg Fausak for
  pointing this out.

- In the server, if no interfaces were configured, report an error and
  exit.

- Don't ever record a state of 'startup'.

- Don't try to evaluate the local failover binding address if none was
  specified.   Thanks to Joseph Breu for finding this.
