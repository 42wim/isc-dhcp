			    Release Notes

This is the final development snapshot before Version 2 of the
Internet Software Consortium DHCP Distribution goes to beta.
Development snapshots after this one will be for Version 3 of the ISC
DHCP Server.

New in this snapshot:

	- more manual pages
	- lots of minor and some major bug fixes.

This snapshot does not fix a number of compile problems that have
been reported (e.g., on Solaris 2.6), nor does it incorporate some
new features that have been contributed. Those problems should be
corrected in the Beta, but please don't hesitate to mention problems
that you have when building this snapshot.

This snapshot is being released in the hopes that a fair number of
DHCP sites will download it, try it out, and submit bug reports and
critique the new manual pages.  Please do not hold back - the plan is
to cut the first Beta release in about two weeks - at the beginning of
December.

Version 1 of the ISC DHCP Distribution included just a DHCP Server.
As of this writing, the most recent Version 1 distribution is Beta 5
Patchlevel 16.  One more patchlevel is planned before Version 1.0 is
finalized.  This is the release that we would expect most sites to run
in production.

Version 2 of the ISC DHCP Distribution adds a DHCP Client and a
DHCP/BOOTP Relay Agent to the DHCP Server that was offered in version
1.0.   In addition, some new capabilities have been added to the
server:

	- IP addresses are now tested before they are assigned to
	  clients.   This allows the DHCP server to detect rogue
	  machines that may have hijacked IP addresses before an IP
	  address conflict can occur.

	- The server may be configured so that some DHCP clients can
	  be excluded from booting.

This version is fairly stable at this time, and will soon be
moved to the "stable" track.   It has a number of new features, and is
the release that we would expect sites that want some stability but
need the new pinging feature, or need a client or relay agent (but
note that you can run the Version 1 server alongside the Version 2
client and relay agent).

Version 3 of the ISC DHCP Distribution will add Dynamic DNS Support,
asynchronous DNS query resolution, DHCP Authentication, and possibly
support for a DHCP Interserver Protocol and live querying of the DHCP
database.   This release is not expected to be stable in the near
future, and is intended for sites that are in a position to
experiment, or for sites that desperately need the new features.
