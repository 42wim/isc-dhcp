/* OMAPI buffers are ring buffers, which means that the beginning of the
   buffer and the end of the buffer chase each other around.   As long as
   the tail never catches up to the head, there's room in the buffer for
   data.

	- If the tail and the head are equal, the buffer is empty.

	- If the tail is less than the head, the contents of the buffer
	  are the bytes from the head to the end of buffer, and in addition,
	  the bytes between the beginning of the buffer and the tail, not
	  including the byte addressed by the tail.

	- If the tail is greater than the head, then the buffer contains
	  valid bytes starting with the byte addressed by the head, and
	  ending with the byte before the byte addressed by the tail.

   There will always be at least one byte of waste, because the tail can't
   increase so that it's equal to the head (that would represent an empty
   buffer. */
