     The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Client, dhclient, pro-
     vides a means for configuring one or more network interfaces
     using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP  proto-
     col,  or if these protocols fail, by statically assigning an
     address.

     The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a central  server
     which maintains a list of IP addresses which may be assigned
     on one or more subnets.    A  DHCP  client  may  request  an
     address from this pool, and then use it on a temporary basis
     for communication on network.   The DHCP protocol also  pro-
     vides  a  mechanism  whereby  a  client  can learn important
     details about the network to which it is attached,  such  as
     the  location  of  a  default router, the location of a name
     server, and so on.

     On startup, dhclient reads the _d_h_c_l_i_e_n_t._c_o_n_f for  configura-
     tion  instructions.   It then gets a list of all the network
     interfaces that are configured in the current system.    For
     each interface, it attempts to configure the interface using
     the DHCP protocol.

     In order to keep track of leases across system  reboots  and
     server restarts, dhclient keeps a list of leases it has been
     assigned in the dhclient.leases(5) file.   On startup, after
     reading   the   dhclient.conf   file,   dhclient  reads  the
     dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
     it has been assigned.

     When a new lease is acquired, it is appended to the  end  of
     the  dhclient.leases  file.    In  order to prevent the file
     from becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time  dhclient
     creates  a  new  dhclient.leases file from its in-core lease
     database.  The old version of the  dhclient.leases  file  is
     retained  under  the  name _d_h_c_p_d._l_e_a_s_e_s~ until the next time
     dhclient rewrites the database.

     Old leases are kept around in case the DHCP server  is  una-
     vailable  when  dhclient  is first invoked (generally during
     the initial system  boot  process).    In  that  event,  old
     leases  from  the  dhclient.leases  file  which have not yet
     expired are tested, and if they are determined to be  valid,
     they  are  used  until either they expire or the DHCP server
     becomes available.

Maintenance Procedures                                dhclient(8)



     A mobile host which may sometimes need to access  a  network
     on which no DHCP server exists may be preloaded with a lease
     for a fixed address on that network.   When all attempts  to
     contact  a  DHCP  server  have  failed, dhclient will try to
     validate the static lease, and if it succeeds, will use that
     lease until it is restarted.

     A mobile host may also travel to some networks on which DHCP
     is  not  available  but  BOOTP is.   In that case, it may be
     advantageous to arrange with the network  administrator  for
     an  entry  on  the BOOTP database, so that the host can boot
     quickly on that network rather than cycling through the list
     of old leases.

     The names of the network  interfaces  that  dhclient  should
     attempt  to  configure may be specified on the command line.
     If no interface names are  specified  on  the  command  line
     dhclient will identify all network interfaces, elimininating
     non-broadcast interfaces if possible, and attempt to config-
     ure each interface.

     If dhclient should listen and transmit on a port other  than
     the  standard (port 68), the ----pppp flag may used.  It should be
     followed by the udp port number that  dhclient  should  use.
     This is mostly useful for debugging purposes.

     Dhclient will normally run in the foreground  until  it  has
     configured  an interface, and then will revert to running in
     the background.  To run force dhclient to always  run  as  a
     foreground  process,  the ----dddd flag should be specified.  This
     is useful when running dhclient under a  debugger,  or  when
     running it out of inittab on System V systems.

     This client  was  substantially  modified  and  enhanced  by
     Elliot  Poger  for  use on Linux while he was working on the
     MosquitoNet project at Stanford.

     The current version owes much  to  Elliot's  Linux  enhance-
     ments,  but  was  substantially  reorganized  and  partially
     rewritten by Ted Lemon so as  to  use  the  same  networking
     framework  that the Internet Software Consortium DHCP server
     uses.   Much system-specific configuration  code  was  moved
     into  a  shell  script so that as support for more operating
     systems is added, it will not be necessary to port and main-
     tain  system-specific  configuration code to these operating
     systems - instead, the shell script can  invoke  the  native
     tools to accomplish the same purpose.
