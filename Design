Objects that need to be tracked:

Node Names
	- A node name is the name of a node attached to a network.
	- Nodes can be any type of hardware that is attached to a
	  network and requires one or more addresses.
	- Node names may be associated with a specific hardware
	  address or set of hardware addresses.
	- Node names may also be associated with a specific IP address
	  or set of IP addresses.

Interfaces
	- An interface is known by its hardware address, which must be
	  unique.   This works for Ethernet, but may be complicated by
	  PPP (?).   What about IBM token ring and FDDI?
	- An interface may be associated with a specific node name,
	  a specific address, or both.

IP Addresses
	- An interface may be associated with a single IP address.
	  4.4BSD supports IP aliasing so that a single interface can
	  have multiple addresses, but this probably isn't worth
	  supporting explicitly.

Transitions
	- A machine may be moved to a different net
	  - If the machine's personality hasn't changed, we may want
	    to assign it a new IP address but keep the same node name.
	  - If the machine's personality *has* changed, we need to
	    assign it both a new node name and a new IP address.
	- A machine's hardware may be upgraded.
	  - The new machine should get the old IP Address and Node Name.
	  - The old machine may need a new IP address and Node Name.

Static Configuration File
	- Addresses which server may assign to arbitrary hosts
	- Addresses which are statically assigned to particular
	  hardware, but which server may need to provide
	- Allowable lease length for a given address

Dynamic Server Database
	- Addresses which have been dynamically assigned
	- The hardware addresses to which they have been assigned
	- The lease expiry time on each assigned address

Sample static configuration file:

# One 12-bit subnet, may assign addresses 240 through 4190.
network 16.3.16.0 netmask 255.255.240.0
	address-range 240 through 4190;
# One 4-bit subnet, may assign addresses 2 through 6.
network 192.5.5.16 netmask 255.255.255.240
	address-range 192.5.5.2 through 192.5.5.6;
# 16 12-bit subnets, may assign addresses 128 through 4190 of each network.
# Address ranges are shared with listed servers [TBI].
networks 16.1.0.0 through 16.1.240.0 netmask 255.255.240.0
	address-range 0.128 through 31.240
	shared-with dhcp-1.pa.dec.com, dhcp-2.pa.dec.com, dhcp-3.pa.dec.com;



Sample database file:
